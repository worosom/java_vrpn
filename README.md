Java vrpn server
=========

This is a minimalistic & easy-to-use vrpn library for java,

providing the possibility to host a button server with an "unlimited" amount of buttons,

and as many analogs as you wish.

---
It's based on the comp523android code from the official vrpn release, packed up to be used as a Java library.

---
I compiled the native library for Mac,

you can find the source to compile for other systems in `src/jvrpn`.
